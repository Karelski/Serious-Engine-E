How this system works?

Here is 3 folders where you can put GROs with content:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 _Custom\  - Folder for maps with custom maps, player models and stuff.
 Base\     - Folder for GROs with vanilla resources.
 Coremods\ - Folder for content replacements. Have higher priority than Base.
